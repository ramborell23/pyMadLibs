  A vacation is when you take a trip to some {{adjective1}} 
  place with your {{adjective2}} family. Usually you go to some 
  place that is near a/an {{noun1}} or up on a/an {{noun2}}.
  A good vacation place is one where you can ride {{plunoun1}} 
  or play {{game}} or go hunting for {{plunoun2}}. I like to spend 
  my time {{verbing1}} or {{verbing2}}.When parents go on a 
  vacation, they spend their time eating three {{plunoun3}} a day,
   and fathers play golf, and mothers sit around {{verbing3}}. 
  Last summer, my little brother fell in a/an {{noun4}} and got 
  poison {{plant}} all over his {{bodypart}}. My family is going 
  to go to {{country}}, and I will practice {{verbing4}}. 
  Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always 
  very {{adjective3}} and because they have to work {{number}} 
  hours every day all year making enough {{plunoun4}} to pay 
  for the vacation.
